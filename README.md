GNL (aka: get_next_line) is a project I completed at [42 Silicon Valley](https://www.42.us.org/).

It allows you to input text files and display them, reading them one line at a time. I've used to project for several other projects that I've done. It's really helpful for project that involve reading input and file. This way I don't have to recreate the capability to read files in every project I do, I just can call on this file and send in my information to it.
